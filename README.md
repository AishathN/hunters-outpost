-----------------------------------------------------

Concept: Hunters And Gatherers is a site designed for two types of people: those who wish to find items, and those who enjoy finding them. The site is designed so that registered 
users may post an item they are looking for, and other users can attempt to find them online and post the whereabouts. Helpful commenters are rewarded points by the 
owner of the original post and can ascend a leaderboard, providing added incentive other than simply being helpful. 

Aesthetics: Hunters And Gatherers was always meant to resemble a game interface to some degree, due to the point scoring and relatively frivolous nature that can 
be associated with the collection of niche items. To that end CSS was used extensively to animated and add glow and hover effects to elements, and scrollbars were 
implemented to keep the page from expanding too far outside of the 'console'.
